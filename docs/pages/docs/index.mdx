## Motivation

There are many ways to identify a wallet address in the cosmos universe. The most common way is to use the bech32 address format. However, this format is not very user-friendly. It is also not very easy to remember. This is why we need a way to identify a wallet address by a human-readable name.

For this purpose, the community has come up with quite a few name-services, a few popular ones are:

1. [ICNS](https://www.icns.xyz)
2. [Stargaze Names](https://www.stargaze.zone/names)
3. [IBC Domains](https://ibc.domains)
4. [ArchId](https://archid.app)
5. [SpaceId](https://space.id)
6. [SNS](https://www.sns.id)
7. [DegeNS](https://www.degens.domains)
8. [Bidds](https://bidds.com)

These services allow users to register a name for their wallet address. However, there is no standard way to resolve these names to wallet addresses. This is where _Name Matcha_ comes in. It is a javascript library that allows you to resolve names to wallet addresses in a standard way.

Just a single line of code is all you need to resolve a name to a wallet address.

## Installation

You can use your favourite package manager to install the library

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm', 'pnpm']}>
